# Plaid Production Compliance Plan

## Current State vs Required State

Your budget planner is currently a **client-side only application** storing data in IndexedDB. For Plaid production access, you'll need to transition to a **secure cloud-hosted architecture** with proper backend infrastructure.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Architecture Transformation (High Priority)

#### 1. Cloud Infrastructure Setup
- **Choose Cloud Provider**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- **Required Services**:
  - Compute: EC2/Cloud Run/App Service
  - Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL with encryption
  - Storage: S3/Cloud Storage for documents
  - CDN: CloudFront/Cloud CDN
  - Load Balancer with TLS termination

#### 2. Backend API Development
```
Current: Direct Plaid calls from browser ❌
Required: Backend API proxy for Plaid ✅
```

**Implementation**:
- Create Node.js/Python backend API
- Move all Plaid SDK calls to backend
- Implement proper API authentication (JWT)
- Store Plaid secrets server-side only

#### 3. Authentication System
- Implement user registration/login
- Add MFA (TOTP/SMS) for all users
- Session management with secure cookies
- Password policies (complexity, rotation)

### Phase 2: Security Controls (High Priority)

#### 4. Encryption Implementation
**Data in Transit**:
- TLS 1.2+ on all endpoints
- HTTPS-only with HSTS headers
- Certificate pinning for mobile apps

**Data at Rest**:
- Database encryption (AWS RDS encryption)
- Encrypt Plaid access tokens
- Encrypt sensitive user data fields

#### 5. Access Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- IP allowlisting for admin functions
- Regular access reviews

### Phase 3: DevOps & Monitoring (Medium Priority)

#### 6. CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Secure Deploy
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  security:
    - Code scanning (SAST)
    - Dependency scanning
    - Secret scanning
  test:
    - Unit tests
    - Integration tests
    - E2E tests
  review:
    - Require code review approval
    - Security team sign-off
```

#### 7. Monitoring & Logging
- **Audit Logging**:
  - All Plaid API calls
  - User authentication events
  - Data access/modifications
  - Admin actions

- **Security Monitoring**:
  - Failed login attempts
  - Unusual access patterns
  - API abuse detection
  - Real-time alerts (PagerDuty/Opsgenie)

### Phase 4: Governance & Compliance (Medium Priority)

#### 8. Security Documentation
Create and maintain:
- Information Security Policy
- Incident Response Plan
- Data Retention Policy
- Vendor Management Policy
- Employee Security Training Materials

#### 9. Privacy Controls
- Privacy Policy update
- Cookie consent banner
- Data deletion workflows
- GDPR/CCPA compliance
- User data export functionality

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Low Priority)

#### 10. Security Testing
- Hire penetration testing firm
- Implement vulnerability scanning
- Regular security audits
- SOC 2 Type II certification (optional but recommended)

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Backend API Structure
```
/api
  /auth
    - POST /login (with MFA)
    - POST /logout
    - POST /refresh
  /plaid
    - POST /link/token (create link token)
    - POST /link/exchange (exchange public token)
    - GET /accounts
    - GET /transactions
  /users
    - GET /profile
    - PUT /settings
    - DELETE /account
```

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Users table (new)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255),
  mfa_secret VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  last_login TIMESTAMP
);

-- Plaid connections (new)
CREATE TABLE plaid_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  access_token_encrypted TEXT,
  item_id VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Audit logs (new)
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  action VARCHAR(255),
  resource_type VARCHAR(255),
  resource_id VARCHAR(255),
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Environment Configuration
```env
# Production environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=xxx
PLAID_SECRET=xxx (encrypted at rest)
PLAID_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=xxx
ENCRYPTION_KEY=xxx
MFA_ISSUER=BudgetPlanner
SENTRY_DSN=xxx
```

## Compliance Checklist

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 4-6 weeks (Architecture & Auth)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks (Security Controls)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (DevOps & Monitoring)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks (Documentation & Compliance)
- **Phase 5**: 2-4 weeks (Testing & Audit)

**Total**: 3-4 months for full compliance

## Budget Considerations

- Cloud hosting: $200-500/month
- SSL certificates: $100-500/year
- Monitoring tools: $100-300/month
- Penetration testing: $10,000-25,000
- SOC 2 audit: $20,000-50,000 (optional)
- Developer time: 3-4 months

## Next Steps

1. Decide on cloud provider
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin backend API development
4. Implement authentication system
5. Gradually migrate features from client to server

This transformation will convert your app from a client-side tool to a production-ready financial application that meets Plaid's security requirements.
