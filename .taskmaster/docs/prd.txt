# Data Ingestion Pipeline - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Build a comprehensive data ingestion pipeline to automatically keep bank statements and transaction data up-to-date in the budget planner application. The pipeline should handle real-time transaction updates, scheduled syncing, webhook processing, and ensure data consistency across multiple data sources.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the budget planner has basic Plaid integration for initial transaction import, but lacks a robust pipeline for ongoing data synchronization. Users need:

1. **Automatic Updates**: Transactions should sync automatically without manual intervention
2. **Real-time Processing**: New transactions should appear quickly after they occur
3. **Webhook Handling**: Proper webhook infrastructure to receive bank notifications
4. **Data Consistency**: Prevent duplicates and handle transaction modifications
5. **Scheduled Syncing**: Fallback mechanism for missed webhook events
6. **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
7. **Multi-source Integration**: Handle both Plaid and manual data sources seamlessly

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

1. **Webhook Infrastructure**
   - Next.js API route for Plaid webhook handling
   - Webhook signature verification for security
   - Event processing for different transaction types (added, modified, removed)
   - Async processing queue for high-volume events

2. **Scheduled Sync Service**
   - Background job scheduler using Node.js cron
   - Configurable sync intervals (hourly, daily, weekly)
   - Incremental sync using Plaid's transactions/sync endpoint
   - Fallback for webhook failures

3. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Transaction deduplication logic
   - Data transformation and validation
   - Category assignment using existing AI/rule system
   - Batch processing for performance

4. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Dead letter queue for failed operations
   - Monitoring and alerting for sync failures
   - Manual recovery tools for admins

5. **Data Consistency**
   - Transaction state management (pending â†’ posted)
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent updates
   - Audit trail for all data changes
   - Backup and restore capabilities

### Implementation Details

**Technology Stack:**
- Next.js API routes for webhook endpoints
- Node.js cron jobs for scheduled tasks
- IndexedDB for client-side storage
- Plaid API for bank data
- Service Worker for offline support

**Database Schema:**
- Transaction versioning for audit trail
- Sync cursor management for incremental updates
- Account connection status tracking
- Error logging and metrics

**Security:**
- Webhook signature verification
- API key rotation support
- Encrypted data storage
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## User Stories

### As a User
- I want my transactions to automatically appear in the app when they occur at my bank
- I want to be notified if there are sync issues with my bank account
- I want to manually trigger a sync if needed
- I want to see when my accounts were last synchronized
- I want confidence that no transactions are missed or duplicated

### As an Admin
- I want to monitor the health of all sync operations
- I want to retry failed sync operations
- I want to see metrics on sync performance and errors
- I want to configure sync schedules and parameters

## Success Criteria

1. **Reliability**: 99.9% of transactions sync successfully within 5 minutes
2. **Performance**: Webhook processing completes within 2 seconds
3. **Accuracy**: Zero duplicate transactions in normal operation
4. **Monitoring**: Full visibility into sync status and errors
5. **Recovery**: Automatic recovery from 95% of sync failures

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Webhook Infrastructure
- Create webhook API endpoint
- Implement signature verification
- Add basic event processing
- Set up error logging

### Phase 2: Scheduled Sync Service
- Build cron job scheduler
- Implement incremental sync
- Add retry mechanisms
- Create admin dashboard

### Phase 3: Data Processing Pipeline
- Enhance deduplication logic
- Improve error handling
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement audit trails

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Real-time notifications
- Conflict resolution
- Advanced monitoring
- Performance optimization

## Dependencies

- Existing Plaid integration
- Current transaction categorization system
- IndexedDB database service
- Error handling infrastructure

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and queuing
- **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup and recovery procedures
- **Security**: Regular security audits and key rotation
- **Performance**: Load testing and optimization
- **Reliability**: Redundant sync mechanisms and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Webhook endpoint receives and processes Plaid events correctly
2. Scheduled sync runs reliably and handles incremental updates
3. No duplicate transactions are created during normal operation
4. Failed sync operations are retried automatically
5. Users can view sync status and manually trigger syncs
6. Admin dashboard shows comprehensive sync metrics
7. All sensitive data is properly encrypted and secured
8. System recovers gracefully from various failure scenarios
